// class BoidTree
//
// An (unfinished) implementation of a quadtree data
// structure for a collection of boids.
//
// A quadtree is a hierarchical data structure for 
// organizing a collection of points in a bounded
// region of the plane.  It is a recursive data
// structure, with leaf nodes and internal nodes.
// Internal nodes have exactly four nodes as 
// children.  Leaves have no children.
//
// Each quadtree object is a node in this tree, 
// of one of three types:
//
//  * an empty leaf: this governs a region of the 
//       plane that contains no collection points.
//
//  * a filled leaf: this governs a region that 
//       contains exactly one point.
//
//  * an internal node: this governs a region that
//       contains two or more points.  It has four
//       quadtree children, each governing one of
//       the four, equal-sized subquadrants of its
//       quadrant. Quadrant 0 is to the lower left,
//       1 is the lower right, 2 is the upper left,
//       and 3 is the upper right.
// 
// We represent a quadtree node for Boid objects,
// each BoidTree instance, with four pieces of 
// information:
//
//    bounds: the rectangle in the plane governed by
//            the node
//    count: the number of points in governed by this
//            node
//    boid: if count=1 then this should be set to the 
//            boid in this "full leaf"
//    children: if count>1 then these should be set to
//            the four subquadrant's nodes
//
// You'll need to write the code for "insert" and "within",
// below.  I have hints as to how these should be 
// written.  You will also want to check BoidTreeBogus
// to see how lists work for writing "within".  You'll
// also want to look at the methods of the class Quad2d
// to see how to handle geometric queries and quadrant
// subdivision.

    // you'll want to use a Boid's "position" (e.g.
    // boid.position and other.position) to have
    // access to the Point2d where the boid sits.
