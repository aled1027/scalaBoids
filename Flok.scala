// LAB 6: using a quadtree to a speed up an n-body simulation
//        or, alternatively, Floks and Boidz!
// 
// Due: Thursday, May 15th, 8am. 
// Hand in: an electronic version of this folder, and
//          a paper printout of your BoidTree.scala code.
//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The code below keeps track of a flok of boids for a boid 
// simulation.
//
// The flok lives in a world of width w and height h, whose
// bounds are the half-open rectangle [-w/2,w/2) x [-h/2,h/2).
// 
// All the boids in the flok have the same behavior, and that 
// behavior is specified by parameters that govern how they 
// reason about the boids near them in the flock.  There are
// three main concerns that govern a boid's behavior:
//
//   * SEPARATION: boids don't want to be too close to each other
//   * VELOCITY MATCHING: boids want to mimic nearby birds' headings
//   * COHESION: boids want to be around other boids
//
// For each of these three components of behavior, a boid pays 
// attention to boids within a certain distance of them.  Each
// component has a RADIUS of concern.  Furthermore, each component
// has COEFFicient of influence on their impulse trajectory.
//
// Each boid's determination of its acceleration, at each moment, 
// gets calculated by the Flok.accelerate method below. The three 
// components of behavior described above are encapsulated in a 
// unit vector that summarizes the influence of the nearby boids.
//
// In the code's current state, there is a boid collection built
// in the Flok.step method.  That collection, named tree, is a 
// "spatial data structure" that answers the geometric question: 
// "Which subset of the boids are within a certain distance of this
// particular boid?"  This is sometimes called a "circular range
// query".  The method call is tree.within(d,b), and gives back a 
// list of boids in the tree's collection that are within distance
// d of boid b. 
//
// Presently, the tree is implemented very simply.  It is not 
// implemented as a tree at all.  It is just a "flat structure"
// of a Scala list.  In the code for Flok.step, you'll see that
// a BoidTreeBogus object is built.  All the boids in the flok 
// are inserted into that with tree.insert, and then, within the 
// accelerate calculation method tree.within is used on that
// the flat/bogus structure.
//
// For the assignment, you are to implement the "BoidTree"
// class, using the existing code in BoidTree.scala as a guide.
// You'll want to make these modifications:
//     * change Flok.step below so it instead builds a BoidTree
//       rather than a BoidTreeBogus
//     * complete the code for BoidTree.insert
//     * complete the code for BoidTree.within
// You'll want to look at the BoidTree.scala file for details on
// this implementation.
